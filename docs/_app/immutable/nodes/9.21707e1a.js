It was a
		similar tool that allowed you to make and export basic audio visualization. I always felt
		limited, and couldn&#39;t imagine the only open source option I knew and enjoyed would die. So, I
		tried my best to take what made Sonic Candle a great tool, and focused on the ability to add
		more customization. While being a project on my spare time, I still try to provide something as
		professional as possible. I am also open to suggestions.</p> <p>Currently, some brainstorming is happening for a rewrite with better architecture, improved
		performance and an improved user interface, using Tauri as a replacement.</p> <ul><li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://design.penpot.app/#/view/82e31d90-3829-8139-8002-c506ce8814c1?page-id=82e31d90-3829-8139-8002-c506ce8814c2&amp;section=interactions&amp;index=0&amp;share-id=dbcc1ffd-3b06-8112-8002-ee511a3f3cd7">PenPot mockup</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Picorims/audio-visualization-tauri">prototype</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Picorims/wav2bar-reborn">rewrite (WIP)</a></strong></li></ul>`,c;return e=new H({props:{projectInfo:y.wav2bar}}),t=new L({props:{projectInfo:y.wav2bar,href:"https://picorims.github.io/wav2bar-website/",$$slots:{explored:[z],weaknesses:[S],strengths:[M]},$$scope:{ctx:p}}}),{c(){v(e.$$.fragment),i=w(),v(t.$$.fragment),s=w(),o=m("section"),o.innerHTML=g},l(a){_(e.$$.fragment,a),i=$(a),_(t.$$.fragment,a),s=$(a),o=u(a,"SECTION",{["data-svelte-h"]:!0}),d(o)!=="svelte-19po8u2"&&(o.innerHTML=g)},m(a,n){x(e,a,n),r(a,i,n),x(t,a,n),r(a,s,n),r(a,o,n),c=!0},p(a,[n]){const b={};n&1&&(b.$$scope={dirty:n,ctx:a}),t.$set(b)},i(a){c||(P(e.$$.fragment,a),P(t.$$.fragment,a),c=!0)},o(a){k(e.$$.fragment,a),k(t.$$.fragment,a),c=!1},d(a){a&&(l(i),l(s),l(o)),I(e,a),I(t,a)}}}class B extends j{constructor(e){super(),C(this,e,null,A,T,{})}}export{B as component};
